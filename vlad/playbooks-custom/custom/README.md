# Custom playbooks

You can add playbooks to the 'custom' role via this directory and its subdirectories. These will be run *after* all optional software has been installed.

Playbooks with the 'custom' role will only be run if "custom_provision" is yet to "y" in settings.yml.

See the 'example' directory for an example of a file structure that you might create here.
