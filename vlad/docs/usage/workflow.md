This page shows a number of different scenarios that Vlad can be used in.

## [Scenario 1: Adding Vlad to an existing git repository](usage/scenario1)

This would perhaps be the most common way of using Vlad in new and existing projects. The only dependency is that it
relies on having the web root directory as a directory within the project.

## [Scenario 2: Using Vlad independently of a repository](usage/scenario2)

If your project files don't have a separate web root directory (i.e. the files are 'flat') then this is the best 
approach for you.
